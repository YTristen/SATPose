By integrating existing human activity datasets ([Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php), [IntelligentCarpet](http://intcarpet.csail.mit.edu/)) and [the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) action set](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4060319/), we have designed and built a large-scale multimodal human activity dataset, the PVM (Pressure, Vision, Mocap) dataset, consisting of 21 actions, encompassing both daily activities and fitness exercises.
